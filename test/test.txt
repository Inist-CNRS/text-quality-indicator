Barnett et al. [1997] examined relationships between a preference for violent games and several personality characteristics. They surveyed 229 individuals aged 15 through 19 years, asking
them to list their five most favorite games. When the most favorite game was rated violent by a
male graduate student, there was an association with lower scores on a measure of trait empathy.
The pattern of partial correlations suggested possible additional relationships with lower selfesteem, less conscientiousness, and relative introversion [Barnett et al., 1997].
Recent research suggests that adult content perceptions may differ from child perceptions,
and therefore it seems important to specifically examine childrenâ€™s content evaluations [Funk et
al., 1999b; Gunter, 1994]. Funk et al. [1998] conducted a survey of 52 sixth graders who listed
and categorized up to three favorite electronic games and completed questionnaires measuring
empathy [Bryant, 1982] and attitudes toward violence [Funk et al., 1999a]. The effect of preference for violent games on empathy score approached significance (P = .07) and the interaction
between time spent and preference for violent games on attitudes toward violence was in the
direction of a small effect. These results, considered with those of Barnett et al. [1997], suggest
that the relationship between a preference for violent games, empathy, and attitudes toward
violence bears further investigation.
